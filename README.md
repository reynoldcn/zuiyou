This project is built for matching the requirement of an interview.

I develop it on Mac OS. It is theoretically executable on Linux but not expected.

I have simply written a Makefile to build this project.
You will find an executable file named main in the same directory.
Have it executed with the path where the log file to be analysed locates, 
like
./main ~/Desktop/server_access.log
